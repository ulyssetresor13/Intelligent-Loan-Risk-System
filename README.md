# Intelligent-Loan-Risk-System
The projectÂ investigates three sophisticated machine learning algorithms - Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, and Naive Bayes - to determine their effectiveness in forecasting loan risk for future venture capital investments. The major goal of this project is to create an intelligent loan risk assessment system that will assist venture capital firms in making data-driven judgments. Using advanced machine learning methods, we want to give insights into the comparative effectiveness of SVM, Decision Tree, and Naive Bayes models in forecasting loan outcomes, supporting venture capitalists in limiting risks and optimizing profits. 


The project focuses on using a dataset that includes crucial aspects such application information, income details, loan amount, and credit history. The selected algorithms will be rigorously evaluated both before and after feature extraction, with a focus on the influence of dimensionality reduction approaches such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
